make an rss generator

create unique feeddirs
for every new message make a file with date_md5hash_title

    eg.
    osnews.com/rss
    tweakers.net/rss
        > read
        v unread
            v 20130112_d41d8cd98f00b204e9800998ecf8427e_this-is-a-title
                content: message content

Do this every half an hour
    parse feeds
        Hash every message 
            check against read and unread dir
                copy new feeds to unread
    if there is a change
        generate html
            give new feeds different color
            mark all as read - create a link to a php file and send name of feed

if mark_all_read.php file is triggered it moves all feeds from unread dir to read dir
