<DIV id="entry_content">I do occasionally have to draw a line between console-based applications, and applications that are intended to run in a terminal emulator. Because occasionally those two genres do not overlap. I can give you peyote today, as a case-in-point. peyote is a music player intended to run in a terminal emulator, and does a fine [...]<img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=inconsolation.wordpress.com&#038;blog=43062292&#038;post=196&#038;subd=inconsolation&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" /></DIV>

<DIV id="entry_content">I promised a few people a screenshot, to show what this machine looks like in action. No fancy setups there. elinks, Midnight Commander, vimwiki and mplayer against the framebuffer at 500Mhz, in Arch Linux.

<DIV id="entry_content">There are a lot of tools and applications that I don&#8217;t quite understand. The optimist in me says I just haven&#8217;t had the opportunity to learn about them yet.

<DIV id="entry_content">I love nifty system monitors. I love colored numbers and spinning counters, lists of processes, mount points and memory use. So something like glances is a terrific toy.

Aside from that, glances has a few sorting options, a [...]<img alt="" border="0" height="1" src="http://stats.wordpress.com/b.gif?host=inconsolation.wordpress.com&#038;blog=43062292&#038;post=239&#038;subd=inconsolation&#038;ref=&#038;feed=1" width="1" /></DIV>
