<DIV id="entry_content">All work and no play makes K.Mandla a dull person. To that end, here&#8217;s ascii-invaders*, a game that&#8217;s likely to run on almost any terminal or console you can connect it to. Left, right and space to fire.

<DIV id="entry_content">There is no guarantee that suffixing the name of your program with &#8220;-top&#8221; will endear it to me. On the other hand, I do like top. And even better is htop.

<DIV id="entry_content">In the ever-expanding network monitor category, it&#8217;s not hard to find something that will illustrate a system&#8217;s communication skills.

<DIV id="entry_content">I do occasionally have to draw a line between console-based applications, and applications that are intended to run in a terminal emulator. Because occasionally those two genres do not overlap.

<DIV id="entry_content">File managers at the console are sometimes a lost cause. For decades now, shifting and sorting has always been done in the graphical arena, and that&#8217;s probably what most people expect. There was a time when two-pane text-only file managers were top dog, and the legacy of that for Linux is the venerable Midnight Commander.
